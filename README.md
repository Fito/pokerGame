# pokerGame

The program includes two shell scripts:
 - compile_game: Compiles game files and packages.
 - run_tests: Compiles game files and runs unit tests.

In order to use these shell scripts you might need to make them executable by running the following commands inside the pokerGame directory:

```sh
  chmod u+x compile_game
  chmod u+x run_tests
```
